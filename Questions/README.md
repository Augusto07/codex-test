# Questions folder

If you are in the Binder/Jupyter notebook, to run each code just click in the play button in the side of each block of code inside of each `.ipynb` file!

## `question1.ipynb`:

Resolution of Question 1. Code that, first, verifies if the given CNPJ have the correct number of characters (or digits). Then, it checks the position of the special characters. Finally it checks if the security digits are valid.

## `question2and3.ipynb`:

This code implements the resolution of Question 2 and 3. First, the code verifies if are points (x, y) in common between the 2 given rectangles. If it's true, then we calculate the area of intersection.

## `question4.ipynb`:

Resolution of Question 4. Code that makes a simple task manager using a `.json` to maintain data between executions. We have 3 options: Create Task, Delete Task and Show All Tasks.

## `question5.ipynb`:

Resolution of Question 5: Code that makes a request from the given API, parse into a .json and prints the UTC date and time.

## `question7.ipynb`:

Resolution of Question 7: Simple sketch of the Entity-Relationship model of the problem and SQL code to create the necessary tables. By the end, we have a query to see the number of items in each order.
